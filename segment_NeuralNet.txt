When learning mathematics as an undergraduate student, there is often a heavy emphasis on grade averages, and on exams which often emphasize memorisation of techniques and theory than on actual conceptual understanding, or on either intellectual or intuitive thought. There are good reasons for this; there is a certain amount of theory and technique that must be practiced before one can really get anywhere in mathematics (much as there is a certain amount of drill required before one can play a musical instrument well). It doesn’t matter how much innate mathematical talent and intuition you have; if you are unable to, say, compute a multidimensional integral, manipulate matrix equations, understand abstract definitions, or correctly set up a proof by induction, then it is unlikely that you will be able to work effectively with higher mathematics. However, as you transition to graduate school you will see that there is a higher level of learning (and more importantly, doing) mathematics, which requires more of your intellectual faculties than merely the ability to memorise and study, or to copy an existing argument or worked example. This often necessitates that one discards (or at least revises) many undergraduate study habits; there is a much greater need for self-motivated study and experimentation to advance your own understanding, than to simply focus on artificial benchmarks such as examinations. It is also worth noting that even one’s own personal benchmarks, such as the number of theorems and proofs from you have memorised, or how quickly one can solve qualifying exam problems, should also not be overemphasised in one’s personal study at the expense of actually learning the underlying mathematics, lest one fall prey to Goodhart’s law.  Such metrics can be useful as a rough assessment of your understanding of a subject, but they should not become the primary goal of one’s study. Whereas at the undergraduate level and below one is mostly taught highly developed and polished theories of mathematics, which were mostly worked out decades or even centuries ago, at the graduate level you will begin to see the cutting-edge, “live” stuff – and it may be significantly different (and more fun) to what you are used to as an undergraduate!

This is a 3. It's sloppily written and rendered at an extremely low resolution of 28 by 28 pixels. But your brain has no trouble recognizing it as a three, and I want you to take a moment to appreciate how crazy it is that brains can do this so effortlessly. I mean, this, this and this are also recognizable as threes, even though the specific values of each pixel is very different from one image to the next. The particular light sensitive cells in your eye that are firing when you see this three are very different from the ones firing when you see this three. But something in that crazy smart visual cortex of yours resolves these as representing the same idea while at the same time recognizing other images as their own distinct ideas. But if I told you, hey, sit down and write for me a program that takes in a grid of 28 by 28 pixels like this. And outputs a single number between 0 and 10, telling you what it thinks the digit is. Well, the task goes from comically trivial to dauntingly difficult unless you've been living under a rock. I think I hardly need to motivate the relevance and importance of machine learning and neural networks to the present and to the future. But what I want to do here is show you what a neural network actually is, assuming no background, and to help visualize what it's doing, not as a buzzword, but as a piece of math. My hope is just that you come away feeling like the structure itself is motivated and to feel like you know what it means when you read or you hear about a neural network, quote UN quote learning this video is just going to be devoted to the structure component of that, and the following one is going to tackle learning. What we're going to do is put together a neural network that can learn to recognize handwritten digits. This is a somewhat classic example for introducing the topic. And I'm happy to stick with the status quo here, because at the end of the two videos I want to point you to a couple good resources where you can learn more and where you can download the code that does this and play with it on your own computer. There are many, many variants of neural networks, and in recent years there's been sort of a boom in research towards these variants. But in these two introductory videos, you and I are just going to look at the simplest plain vanilla form with no added frills. This is kind of a necessary prerequisite for understanding any of the more powerful modern variants, and trust me, it still has plenty of complexity for us to wrap our minds around. But even in this simplest form, it can learn to recognize handwritten digits, which is a pretty cool thing for a computer to be able to do. And at the same time, you'll see how it does fall short of a couple hopes that we might have for it. As the name suggests, neural networks are inspired by the brain, but let's break that down. What are the neurons, and in what sense are they linked together?Right now, when I say neuron, all I want you to think about is a thing that holds a number, specifically a number between zero and one. It's really not more than that. For example, the network starts with a bunch of neurons corresponding to each of the 28 * 28 pixels of the input image, which is 784 neurons in total. Each one of these holds a number that represents the grayscale value of the corresponding pixel, ranging from zero for black pixels up to one for white pixels. This number inside the neuron is called its activation, and the image you might have in mind here is that each neuron is lit up when its activation is a high number. So all of these 784 neurons make up the first layer of our network. Now jumping over to the last layer. This has 10 neurons, each representing one of the digits. The activation in these neurons, again some number that's between zero and one, represents how much the system thinks that a given image corresponds with a given digit. There's also a couple layers in between, called the hidden layers, which for the time being. Should just be a giant question mark for how on earth this process of recognizing digits is going to be handled in this network. I chose 2 hidden layers, each one with 16 neurons, and admittedly that's kind of an arbitrary choice. To be honest, I chose 2 layers based on how I want to motivate the structure in just a moment. And 16, well, that was just a nice number to fit on the screen. In practice, there is a lot of room for experiment with a specific structure here. The way the network operates, activations in one layer determine the activations of the next layer. And of course, the heart of the network as an information processing mechanism comes down to exactly how those activations from one layer bring about activations in the next layer. It's meant to be loosely analogous to how, in biological networks of neurons, some groups of neurons firing cause certain others to fire. Now, the network I'm showing here has already been trained to recognize digits, and let me show you what I mean by that. It means if you feed in an image lighting up all 784 neurons of the input layer according to the brightness of each pixel in the image, that pattern of activations causes some very specific pattern in the next layer, which causes some pattern in the one after it, which finally gives some pattern in the output layer and the brightest neuron of that output layer. Is the network's choice, so to speak, for what digit this image represents. And before jumping into the math for how one layer influences the next, or how training works, let's just talk about why it's even reasonable to expect a layered structure like this to behave intelligently. What are we expecting here?What is the best hope for what those middle layers might be doing?Well, when you or I recognize digits, we piece together various components. A nine has a loop up top and a line on the right. An 8 also has a loop up top, but it's paired with another loop down low. A4 basically breaks down into three specific lines and things like that. Now in a perfect world, we might hope that each neuron in the second to last layer corresponds with one of these subcomponents, that anytime you feed in an image with, say, a loop up top, like a nine or an 8, there's some specific neuron whose activation is going to be close to 1. And I don't mean this specific loop of pixels. The hope would be that any generally loopy pattern towards the top sets off this neuron. That way, going from the third layer to the last one just requires learning which combination of subcomponents corresponds to which digits. Of course, that just kicks the problem down the road, because how would you recognize these subcomponents or even learn what the right subcomponents should be?And I still haven't even talked about how one layer influences the next, but run with me on this one for a moment. Recognizing a loop can also break down into sub problems. One reasonable way to do this would be to 1st recognize the various little edges that make it up. Similarly, a long line like the kind you might see in the digits one or four or seven, well, that's really just a long edge. Or maybe you think of it as a certain pattern of several smaller edges. So maybe our
