Now one of the most common causes is simple derailer adjustment on modern derailers with index shifting. The pulleys in the cage here should line up with the cog that the chain is on, and what happens is if the adjustment is slightly off to where the police are slightly off of, not in the line with the the COG there. Maybe it seemed in between two cogs that the chain especially. Their torque might try to jump to the next cog and then maybe back again and so you simply need to adjust the derailer. Have some videos that where they were adjusted derailers, but basically you're going to adjust the barrel adjuster here and adjust it so that the pulleys come over and line up with the cog that the chain is on and that will often solve the problem.

Today on the Stay at Home Chef, I'm showing you how to cook steak perfectly every time. This method works for any kind of steak and will help you achieve the perfect steak every single time. There's no need to be intimidated by cooking steak because it's actually super easy and I'm going to show you how. The first thing you need to do is pull your steaks out and let them sit at room temperature for at least 30 minutes. If you're using frozen steaks, you'll want to thaw them in the fridge first, but you do want them. To come to room temperature, and if you'll notice, we're using nice thick steaks. Thick steaks are actually easier to cook. Perfectly thin steaks will cook too fast and may even dry out. So choose a good thick steak. Today we're using a couple of New York strip steaks, but this same method works with rib eye or T-bone or even fillet. So choose a cut of steak that you like. You can see this steak has some nice marbling in it and some fat around the outside. There are actually three different grades of beef, Select, Choice, and prime, and it's all based on the marbling and flavor in the beef. Now, the difference between select and choice is actually pretty big, so I always recommend choosing at least Choice, grade or Prime grade beef when you're making steak. This is actually a choice grade New York steak.

Now I'll demonstrate how the pan should be hot when frying something. So, what's called a hot pan? Let me show you. I'll open it. Then we pour in the oil. Did you see how beautiful the oil temperature is? Many people think that when the oil comes out, the pan is ready. But actually, the real readiness of the pan is like this. Can you see the smoke? When it smokes, it means the pan is ready. At this point, we reduce the heat a little. Okay, after the pan is ready, we start. Crack the eggs into it. Oh. Yes, right. Yes, right. Basically, once the pan is ready, when you fry this, it won't stick to the pan. Just lightly move it around. It won't stick. Just give it a gentle shake. Shake it left and right. Wherever you want it to go, it will go. Relax, you don't have to worry about sticking to the pan. Okay, let's go. Thank you, squad leader. It's that simple. It won't stick to the pan at all. The principle is very simple. When the pan reaches a certain high temperature, when you crack the egg in, the water vapor instantly evaporates, forming a layer of steam between the pan and the egg. That's the basic principle of non-stick pan. Because I like the crispy part, I added a little bit of glue to the skin. That's all. Neat and clean, effortlessly. Alright, that's it. We completed this simple non-stick fried egg easily.
