When learning mathematics as an undergraduate student, there is often a heavy emphasis on grade averages, and on exams which often emphasize memorisation of techniques and theory than on actual conceptual understanding, or on either intellectual or intuitive thought. There are good reasons for this; there is a certain amount of theory and technique that must be practiced before one can really get anywhere in mathematics (much as there is a certain amount of drill required before one can play a musical instrument well). It doesn’t matter how much innate mathematical talent and intuition you have; if you are unable to, say, compute a multidimensional integral, manipulate matrix equations, understand abstract definitions, or correctly set up a proof by induction, then it is unlikely that you will be able to work effectively with higher mathematics. However, as you transition to graduate school you will see that there is a higher level of learning (and more importantly, doing) mathematics, which requires more of your intellectual faculties than merely the ability to memorise and study, or to copy an existing argument or worked example. This often necessitates that one discards (or at least revises) many undergraduate study habits; there is a much greater need for self-motivated study and experimentation to advance your own understanding, than to simply focus on artificial benchmarks such as examinations. It is also worth noting that even one’s own personal benchmarks, such as the number of theorems and proofs from you have memorised, or how quickly one can solve qualifying exam problems, should also not be overemphasised in one’s personal study at the expense of actually learning the underlying mathematics, lest one fall prey to Goodhart’s law.  Such metrics can be useful as a rough assessment of your understanding of a subject, but they should not become the primary goal of one’s study. Whereas at the undergraduate level and below one is mostly taught highly developed and polished theories of mathematics, which were mostly worked out decades or even centuries ago, at the graduate level you will begin to see the cutting-edge, “live” stuff – and it may be significantly different (and more fun) to what you are used to as an undergraduate!

The first tip is going to be talking about breathing. Establishing a rhythm with your breathing is a vital step to keep you honest with your pacing, but also establish a good communication with your posture. So what we're going to do, or what you're going to do for this, is for your long run. Every one mile, you're going to spend the first minute of that mile only breathing in through your notes. You're welcome to breathe out through your mouth. But adjust your pace as needed to allow yourself to breathe only into your nose and out through your mouth. The reason we're going to do that is because when we breathe through our nose, it's a good way for us to reestablish communication with our diaphragm. And when we do that, we tend to build a lot more stability in our run, and we avoid the kind of side shifting that we might see. So breathing in through your nose is a good way to start to use your diaphragm again. Step 2 is going to be in reference to your cadence. Cadence is how many steps you take in a minute, and it's one of the things that will quickly degrade as fatigue starts setting in more and more. So we all have a natural cadence. Mine is around one 78180 steps in a minute, and I know that because I've used and trained with a metronome many times. Will link to some for you to use for this drill in our description. But what you're going to do is on your long run, you're going to figure out your natural cadence and you're going to check in with it with 10% left in your mileage on the run. And this final tip is one of the more important ones because it's one of the ways that we're going to keep our legs feeling fresh in those later stages of our long run. We've all done this where we are really, really, really tight in the later stage of our long run. So this is the way that we deal with it. What we're going to do is halfway through our long run, we're going to start either doing air squats. Or leg swings. So let's say I'm doing a 20 mile run. At mile 10, I'm going to slow and come to a stop. This is an opportunity for me to catch my breath for a second. But also this is where I'm going to start to do my air squats. I'll pick back up for the remaining part of that mile And now for the rest of my long run. Every mile, I'm going to stop and either be doing 10 air squats or ten leg swings. So that first stop, I'm doing air squats. The second stop, I'm going to do leg swings, and then I'm going back and forth for the remainder of my run.

First off, the filet of beef. Now look at it, it's beautiful. First, the most important part is to sear it. Salt, pepper. Very, very hot. Olive oil and literally roll it around the pan. We're not cooking the beef, we're just searing it, which will really help to give another layer of flavour and beef in. Lovely. Now use the side of the pan so the beef sears down the back when you felt it. It gives that really nice roasted flavor. Lift up the beef and see it on top. And say it on the bottom out and onto the plate. English mustard. What this does now, it gives it a bit of sort of bit of heat, just slightly brush The mustard over the beef. As the beef comes straight out of the pan as the beast starts to cool down, it absorbs all that heat from the mustard. Prepare the filling, which is called a dug sale. Put 700 grams of chestnut mushrooms into a blender, add a chopped clove of garlic, seasoning with salt and pepper, and blitz. Christmas wouldn't be Christmas without chestnuts. The chestnuts sweet nutty flavor works brilliantly with the earthy taste of the mushrooms, and because they contain more starch and less oil than other nuts, they have a much softer texture that is perfect for the filling. Once the mixture is finely chopped, cooking a hot dry pan. This removes the water from the mushrooms and intensifies the flavor. You can see the water coming out instantly. Such an essential stage, really critical to the success of the Wellington, that you dry those mushrooms out and get rid of all that water. When all the water has been fried off, removed from the pan and lead to cool, then start assembling the Wellington. Wrapping the beef fillet. First of all these wonderful slices of Parma ham and look. Peaceful. Overlap it. And set it there. So the secret of overlapping the Palmer Ham is to make sure it contains all those juices. Coming out of the beef in the traditional recipe for beef Wellington, a thick chive and spring onion pancake is used instead of ham, but the Parma ham makes the dish much lighter and it's sweet. Salty flavor really complements the mushroom and chestnut filling. Now we're going to lift that up and wrap. The beef. Nice and carefully. So, all that mushroom and Palmer ham. Is encasing the beef all the way over. Push it nice and tight. Then bake in an oven at 200 degrees for around 35 minutes, depending on how rare you like your beef. Once out of the oven, it's crucial you let the Wellington rest for at least 10 minutes.
